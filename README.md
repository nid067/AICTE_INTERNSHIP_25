EV_Adoption_Forecasting.ipynb
This is a Jupyter Notebook that contains Python code for forecasting the adoption of electric vehicles. It likely includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps. You can view the code and its outputs to understand the entire forecasting process. 

Electric_Vehicle_Population_By_County.csv
This CSV file contains the raw data used for the project. It likely includes information about the number of electric vehicles in different counties, along with other relevant features. 

preprocessed_ev_data.csv
This is another CSV file, and as the name suggests, it contains a preprocessed version of the Electric_Vehicle_Population_By_County.csv data. The EV_Adoption_Forecasting.ipynb notebook likely performs data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering on the raw data and saves the result in this file.

forecasting_ev_model.pkl
This is a pickle file, which is a serialized Python object. In this case, it is most likely a trained machine learning model that was created and saved from the EV_Adoption_Forecasting.ipynb notebook. This file can be loaded to make predictions on new data without having to retrain the model.
